# To-Do List Project

## 📌 About

The classic project about To-Do-List. 
This project has practical purposes.

## 💡 Main Ideas
  - Start developing with what I know.

  - Once I gain some proficiency in Spring Boot, I want to refactor it with better practices.



## 🛢️ Database Configuration
- The project uses a local PostgreSQL database.
- You can find and customize the configuration in the `application.yml` file.
- The SQL file that defines the tables can be found at:
`src\main\java\com\henrique\to_do_list\sqldata-base-structure.sql`
